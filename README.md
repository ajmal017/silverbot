silverbot
=========

Simplistic IB TWS trading bot with a focus on profiting from market volatility

Prerequisites
=============

Python 3

PyYAML - pip install pyyaml
GSpread - pip install gspread (http://burnash.github.io/gspread/)

Trader Workstation - Downloadable from InteractiveBrokers
IbPy - https://code.google.com/p/ibpy/

Usage
=====
This is not safe to use.  Therefore, it is not easy to run.  Here are the general steps:

1) Run Trader Workstation, enable local API access
2) Set up auth.yaml -- if you aren't sure what it looks like or how to find out, 
   you almost certainly should not be running this application!
3) Run 'python easy_trader.py'

WARNING: This is an easy way to lose lots of money!
